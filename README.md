## ðŸ§  How It Works

The app uses **Socket.IO** to create persistent connections between clients and the server. Here's the process:

- Users are prompted for a nickname and added to a live user list.
- Messages are sent and received in real-time.
- When users type, a "typing..." status is shown to others.
- Users joining or leaving triggers a system message.
- The frontend updates dynamically with all chat and status changes.
